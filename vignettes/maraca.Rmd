## Visualization


### Setup

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("hex-hce.png", dpi = 1000)
```

Load the package `hce` and check the version:

```{r setup}
library(hce)
packageVersion("hce")
```

For citing the package, run `citation("hce")` [@hce].

### The Maraca Plot

The *maraca* plot (named for its visual similarity to the musical instrument) has been recently introduced [@karpefors2023maraca] for the visualization of HCEs, which combine multiple dichotomous outcomes with a single continuous endpoint. The maraca plot visualizes the contribution of components of a hierarchical composite endpoint (HCE) over time. It is formed by adjoining, from left to right, uniformly scaled Kaplanâ€“Meier plots of times to each dichotomous outcome among those without more severe outcomes, with a superimposed box/violin plot of the continuous outcome.

The maraca plot is implemented in the `maraca` package [@maraca], which depends on the `hce` package. The `maraca` package includes a `plot.hce()` method to visualize objects of type `hce`. Consider the following example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(maraca)
Rates_A <- 10
Rates_P <- 15
dat <- simHCE(n = 1000, n0 = 500, TTE_A = Rates_A, TTE_P = Rates_P, 
              CM_A = 0.2, CM_P = 0, seed = 2, shape = 0.35)
plot(dat)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("maraca.png", dpi = 100)
```

The example illustrates a maraca plot with a single dishotomous outcome combined with a continuous outcome. The dischotmous outcomes over time are simulated from a Weibull distribution with `shape = 0.35` in both treatment groups. The `rate` parameter in the active group is 10 per 100 patients per year, and 15 in the control group (100 patients per year is the default value).
