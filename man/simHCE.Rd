\title{Simulate \code{hce} object with given event rates of time-to-event outcomes (Weibull), mean and SD of the continuous outcome (normal or log-normal) by treatment group}
\usage{

  n,
  n0 = n,
  TTE_A,
  TTE_P,
  CM_A,
  CM_P,
  CSD_A = 1,
  CSD_P = CSD_A,

  pat = 100,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size in the active treatment group.}

\item{n0}{sample size in the placebo group.}

\item{TTE_A}{event rates per year in the active group for the time-to-event outcomes.}

\item{TTE_P}{event rates per year in the placebo group for the time-to-event outcomes. Should have the same length as \code{TTE_A}.}

\item{CM_A}{mean value for the continuous outcome of the active group.}

\item{CM_P}{mean value for the continuous outcome of the placebo group.}

\item{CSD_A}{standard deviation for the continuous outcome of the active group.}

\item{CSD_P}{standard deviation for the continuous outcome of the placebo group.}

\item{fixedfy}{length of follow-up in years.}

\item{yeardays}{number of days in a year.}

\item{pat}{scale of provided event rates (per \code{pat}-years).}

\item{shape}{shape of the Weibull distribution for time-to-event outcomes. Default is exponential distribution with \code{shape = 1}.}

\item{theta}{Gumbel dependence coefficient of the Weibull distributions for time-to-event outcomes. Default is \code{theta = 1} which assumes independence of time-to-event outcomes. Must be above or equal to 1.}

\item{logC}{logical, whether to use log-normal distribution for the continuous outcome.}

\item{seed}{for generating random numbers.}

\item{dec}{decimal places for the continuous outcome used for rounding. The default is \code{dec = 2}.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{hce} containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item ID subject identifier.
\item TRTP planned treatment group - "A" for active, "P" for Placebo.
\item GROUP type of the outcome, either "TTE" for time-to-event outcomes or "C" for continuous.
Only one continuous outcome is possible, but no restriction on the number of "TTE" outcomes.
\item GROUPN order of outcomes in \code{GROUP}, with a higher value signifying a better outcome.
\item AVALT the timing of the time-to-event outcomes.
\item AVAL0 numeric values of the continuous outcome and the timing of "TTE" outcomes.
\item AVAL analysis values derived as \code{AVAL0 + GROUPN}. For the continuous outcome the values of \code{AVAL0} are shifted to start always from 0.
\item seed the seed of the random sample. If not specified in \code{seed} argument will be selected based on system time.
\item PADY primary analysis day, the length of fixed follow-up in days calculated as \code{yeardays} multiplied by \code{fixedfy}.
